Aliases on this work repo all contain sensitive information (account data etc) as they pertain to my work. So this is not included in the dotfiles repo. 
Aliases are loaded by a simple if statement that checks if ~/.zsh/zshalias exists.
You can add your aliases there as per normal, this allows me to manage multiple aliase's across machines while keeping the same core zsh configuration.
